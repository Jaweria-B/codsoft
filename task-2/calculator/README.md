Welcome to the Scientific Calculator! This calculator app allows you to perform various mathematical operations ranging from basic arithmetic to trigonometric functions and more!

## Features 🌟

- Addition (➕)
- Subtraction (➖)
- Multiplication (✖)
- Division (➗)
- Square Root (√)
- Trigonometric Functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Exponential Functions (x^2, x^n)

## Usage 🚀

1. Enter the first number in the input field labeled "Enter the first number."
2. Optionally, enter the second number in the input field labeled "Enter the second number."
3. Select the desired operation by clicking on the corresponding button.
4. The result of the operation will be displayed below the buttons.

## Instructions 📝

- For basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), simply click on the corresponding button to perform the calculation.
- For the square root operation, click on the "√ Square Root" button.
- For trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), click on the respective button to calculate the function of the first number.
